# The Lost Prince

For this group project, four of us designed a browser game in the style of retro text-based adventures, using dice rolls to decide damage in combat. The player chooses which path they'd like to go down and tries to make it to the end whilst avoiding traps, fighting enemies, and picking up health packs.

We followed the Agile methodology to work well as a team and created the project with JavaScript, as well as HTML and CSS for the front-end design. 

### To run the game:

* In the terminal, enter the following commands to run the JavaScript code and open the browser:
    1) *npm install*
    2) *npm run build*
    3) *open client/public/index.html*




### The brief for the project:

#### Browser Game
Create a browser game based on an existing card or dice game. Model and test the game logic and then display it in the browser for a user to interact with.

Write your own MVP with some specific goals to be achieved based on the game you choose to model.

You might use persistence to keep track of the state of the game or track scores/wins. Other extended features will depend on the game you choose.
